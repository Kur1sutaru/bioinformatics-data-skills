* Use existent libraries whenever possible
* Spend time developing frequently used scripts into tools
* Release your code and data
* Use code as documentation
* Continually improving your bioinformatics data skills
* Use clear name to data, archives and directories
* Document your methods and workflows
* Document the origin of all datain your project directory
* Document when your downloaded data
* Record data version information
* Describe how you downloaded the data
* Document the versions of the software that you ran
